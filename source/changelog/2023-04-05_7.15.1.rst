Since yesterday a little release slipped through our fingers onto the servers, beside the final removement 
of PHP7.4 there are some minor additions to your Asteroids. 

Because our main focus now lies on the development of the `next <https://blog.uberspace.de/ll-4-liebes-logbuch/>`_ 
Uberspace generation, our release cycle in U7 could evolve to a more frequent but smaller feature set. We'll 
see how it all comes together in the coming period.

PHP 7.4 removal
---------------

We have now removed the outdated PHP 7.4 version from our servers. All users who reverted to version 8.0 after 
the deprecation period have now been permanently migrated.

MariaDB updates
---------------

The MariaDB updates we implemented within the last weeks on all hosts are finished now and all instances were 
updated to version `10.6 <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-server-10-6/>`_.

Changed
-------

- ``mytop`` came with the newer MariaDB versions and is available now as an alternative to ``mtop``
- the nice editor ``ne`` is now available
- ``kitty`` terminals should now work since we added the necessary terminfo mail-filters
- we changed the backup time for mysql databases from ``02:00`` to ``01:59``. You may now fiddle out why this is a much better idea and why we had a lot of alarms for missing backups on a sunday a week and a half before ;-)
