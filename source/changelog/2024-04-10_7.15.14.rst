Features
--------
* You may now use "minussed" mailaddresses like ``mailbox-ebay@example.com``. This makes it easier to migrate mailaddresses from ``.qmail`` configurations (we already provide the more common format ``mailbox+ebay@example.com``).
* We run a hourly healthchecks on the userspaces to kill stucked PHP Worker processes. We will notify you by mail and add an entry to the ``php_error`` log.

Deprecations
------------
* PHP 8.0 has been completely removed from our systems
* Users using Ruby3.0 have been migrated to Ruby3.1. We will disable the outdated version 3.0 one month later.
