Added
-----

- We added ``msmtp`` so you can easily switch sending mails over SMTP instead of sendmail. This will give you all the benefits of real mailboxes like DKIM signed mails.
- NodeJS 20 is now available for you.

Changed
-------

- We now have a stricter mail outgoing limit for new accounts. Until the first cash top-up, you will only be able to send ``5mails/60min``.
- The limit for all other outgoing mails has been set to ``200mails/60min`` according to our houserules.
- We now reject *outgoing* mails with a high spam score.

Deprecations
------------

- NodeJS 12+14 will be no longer selectable. They will be completely removed in the end of June.
- NodeJS 19 will soon be deprecated, please switch to the now added NodeJS 20.
- Ruby 2.7 will soon be deprecated, please switch to newer versions.
